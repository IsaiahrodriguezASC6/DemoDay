</head>About Us
<body>
    <h1>FirstLevel is an online market specializing in video games. We made this site because many companies are going downhill
        <br><br> because of the fact that technology is making your purchases more convient to come by. For example why go to a Toys R us when
        <br><br> Amazon can bring you anything you want whenever as well as wherever. Blockbuster is another example of technology taking
        <br><br>  over; you wouldn't want to get in your car or a bus to go to a store just to get a movie if it hasn't already been taken. Netflix and
        <br><br> YouTube are the king and queen of digital media and has made lives much easier. This is what we want to do with video games. 
        <br><br>  We don't want to put any companies out of business but we want to make lives much easier to not only get a game (rare or not) 
        <br><br> that they want, but show them games that they might really like. Many other online markets show you things that you already saw 
        <br><br>multiple times or products that they really want to sell, not becaue you want it, but because they want to get rid of it. We want to 
        <br><br> show you things that we feel you will really want. If statistics are showing that you are not really interested in something for 
        <br><br>example, Mario games, expect to not see it until you start showing interest, and even when you do we won't shove it in your face.
